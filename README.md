## Objective of the game
The main objective is to take the hero from the beginning of the level's map to the end without him touching forbidden obstacles. Furthermore, as a second objective,
he has to catch the maximum possible of power-ups, such as coins, points and stars.

## Features implemented
Our game consists, for now, in 3 levels. It has several characters and static features related to the map of the levels:
* Hero
* Bats
* Spikes
* Walls
* End level
* Stars
* Coins
* Points

Besides that, Simple Tomb of the Mask was designed to have some power-ups referred in the list above, like coins, stars and points.

## Design patterns used
* State Pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state. In more detail, this design pattern is used to provide a systematic and loosely-coupled way to achieve the change of the behaviour of
  an Object based on its state through context and state implementations.
* Observer Pattern is used to get notified whenever there is any change of the state of an Object.
